# Project: Food Blog
## Description 
A food blog made in react. Connected to my [REST API](https://github.com/natbibi/my-rest-api) to fetch food post's data.

## Installation and Usage

Clone or download this repo:

To start client:   
    `npm install`   
    `npm run dev`

## Process 
1. Create a front end in react with a previously made [react template](https://github.com/natbibi/react-template)
2. Add necessary pages, routes and add to navlink 
3. Using axios, fetch data from my [REST API](https://github.com/natbibi/my-rest-api)

- [x] upload multiple images per post / UI in progress ðŸš§

- [x] images not loading in production -> SOLVED changed from .png to .jpg, change casing to lower case and use relative path
