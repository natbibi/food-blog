[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6a27d0fa-401c-418b-9287-3c99a94a2854/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/stesfood/deploys)
## Description 
A food blog made in react. Connected to my [REST API](https://github.com/natbibi/my-rest-api) to fetch food post's data.

## Installation and Usage

Clone or download this repo:

To start client:   
    `npm install`   
    `npm run dev`  
The client will open on port 8080   

## Technologies  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  

### Dependencies: 

   - Client: bootstrap, react, react-bootstrap, router-dom, react-router-dom, react-icons, styled-components
   
### DevDependencies:
   
   - Client: babel, webpack, axios, testing-library, jest, loaders, sass, 

## Process 
1. Create a front end in react with a previously made [react template](https://github.com/natbibi/react-template)
2. Add necessary pages, routes and add to navlink 
3. Using axios, fetch data from my [REST API](https://github.com/natbibi/my-rest-api) 

### TODOS
- [x] add correct email address and activate formsubmit.io 
- [x] upload multiple images per post / UI in progress ðŸš§
- [ ] add [search filter](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/#djangofilterbackend) option
- [ ] add options to switch between gallery view and list view
- [x] render 'eatin' when posts have been added - match style of 'eatout'
- [ ] improve mobile burger nav UX - closing nav bar on click of link
- [ ] improve load speeds - currently images take long to load, esp on mobile devices

## Bugs
- [x] unreponsive on mobile devices 
- [x] images not loading in production -> SOLVED changed from .png to .jpg, change casing to lower case and use relative path   
- [x] dynamic id routing not working since data is fetched in descending order -> SOLVED use .find and match.params 
- [x] nav bar background blocking text in mobile 
- [x] favicon not displaying in dev or production -> link to url instead (https://i.ibb.co/tYjPmCW/stemoji.png)
